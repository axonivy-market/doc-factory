    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>The aim of this document is to provide a small description of the file management system
      that has been developed for our Ivy RIAs applications. This file management system eases the
      integration of File exchange, communication, edition and creation in your Ivy RIAs
      applications. </para>

    <title>File management system overview</title>
    <para>The file management system is a set of Java Classes, Ivy Data Classes and Rich Dialogs
      that interoperates to be able to perform actions on files located on a Server File System or
      in a database just as they were located on the user's computer. You will find all those rich
      dialogs under <ns:code>ch.ivyteam.ivy.ivyaddons.filemanager</ns:code>. </para>
    <ns:warning>
      <para> The File Management System needs Java 6 at client side as a prerequisite. </para>
    </ns:warning>
    <para>The Users are then going to share the same files among an application. They will be able
      to edit, print, copy, zip or download those files. They will also be able to upload some Files
      from their computer to the server.</para>
    <para>The file management system doesn't work with Ivy File Objects. It works with java.io.File
      objects and moreover with
      <ns:code>ch.ivyteam.ivy.addons.filemanager.DocumentOnServer</ns:code> Objects. A
      DocumentOnServer is just a DataClass representing a java.io.File within the file management
      system and contains some informations like the File size, a short description, the date and
      time of creation and last modification or if it is already edited (locked) by someone.</para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 xml:id="ivy.addons.filemanager.thefilemanagerRDC">
    <title>The FileManager RDC</title>
    <para>The FileManager Rich Dialog is the most important Rich Dialog of the file management
      system. </para>
    <para>It is visually composed by two main areas: a menu at the top and a split pane at the
      bottom. The split pane is divided in two regions: the folder explorer (RTree) and a RTable
      that lists the files contained into the selected folder. The top level Folder is given in the
      start method of the Filemanager Rich Dialog. The user cannot see the files and directories
      over this directory. The table displays some informations about the files: the name, the size,
      the Ivy User who created the File (by upload or by copy), the date and time of creation). It
      shows also in a tool tip the Ivy User who has last modified the file. It also shows a little
      Lock as icon if the file is currently edited, with the Ivy User name who is working with the
      file. If the user opens a file that is already edited by a third person, his changes are not
      going to be kept.</para>

      <title>FileManager RDC Initialization</title>
      <para>This section describes how to start and use the FileManager. </para>
      <ns:warning>
        <para> The ivy users must have at least the two following rights:
            <ns:emphasis>ExternalDatabaseConfigurationReadMaxConnections</ns:emphasis> and
            <ns:emphasis>ExternalDatabaseConfigurationReadDatabaseConnectionConfiguration</ns:emphasis></para>
      </ns:warning>
      <para>There are two major informations to provide the FileManager: the <ns:emphasis>server
          path</ns:emphasis> representing the top directory that will be displayed, and the
          <ns:emphasis>database informations</ns:emphasis> to be able to retrieve the files
        informations.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>The Server path</title>
        <para>The server path is provided as parameter in the start methods of the RDC. This
          parameter can be an empty String. In such a case nothing is going to be displayed and the
          user will not be able to do anything. You can set the server Path dynamically at a delayed
          time with the <ns:code>setServerPath(String _serverPath)</ns:code> method. </para>
        <para>If you provide a path like "Test/dir1/", the directories and theirs files are going to
          be located at the root of the Ivy Server installation directory. If the path is like
          "/test/dir1/...", the directories and theirs files are going to be located at the root of
          the drive. You can also provide a path like "C:/test/...".</para>
        <para>You can connect to a file share server path with for example
            <ns:emphasis>"//ServerShareName/dir1/"</ns:emphasis>. In such a case the file sharing
          must be configured so that the Ivy Server User can connect to it. </para>

          <para>You can use the IvySystem DB to store the informations on the files, or you can use
            an external Database System.</para>
          <para>If your table is located on the Ivy System Database you just have initialize the

    <title>Other Framework Dialogs</title>
    <para>Beside the FileManager Rich Dialog you will find a collection of other rich dialogs that
      can be usefull in your applications. This documentation doesn't describes those rich dialogs
      in details. We just provide a short overview of them. Please read their Ivy Interfaces'
      documentation for more informations. </para>
    <para>Those Rich dialogs can be devided in two groups:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The first Group contains two Rich Dialogs responsible for the Actions upon the
            Files. The major Rich Dialog in this Group is the
            <ns:emphasis>DesktopHandler</ns:emphasis>. This RDC is used as interface between the
            visual rich dialogs and the Java Classes developed to be able to perform actions on the
            files. This Rich Dialog was named "DesktopHandler" because it allows executing the
            methods contained in the <ns:code>java.awt.Desktop</ns:code> java Class. This
            DesktopHandler contains the other invisible Rich Dialog of this collection: the
              <ns:emphasis>FileEditorChecker</ns:emphasis>. This Rich Dialog is responsible for the
            persistency of the changes in a File edition. There should be no reason to have to
            implement directly this last rich dialog into your applications.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The Second Group contains 7 Rich Dialogs other than the FileManager:<ns:orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>The <ns:emphasis>FileActionOptionPane</ns:emphasis>: it should be used as
                  Synchronous "popup" Window to perform an action (edit, print, download) on a given
                  File. It contains a DesktopHandler to be able to edit or print the File.</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>The <ns:emphasis>SimpleFileActionChooserPane</ns:emphasis>: this Rich Dialog
                  doesn't contain a DesktopHandler. He cannot perform the edit or print actions from
                  itself. With this Rich Dialog you just choose upon "edit" or "print". It returns
                  "edit" if the user presses on the "Edit" button or "print" if the user presses on
                  the "Print" one. Else it returns "cancel". The Rich Dialog that calls this
                  SimpleFileActionChooserPane should then contains a DesktopHandler to perform the
                  choosed action.</para>

              <listitem>
                <para>The <ns:emphasis>FileListChooserPane</ns:emphasis> is just composed by a
                  ComboBox. It should be inserted into a parent Rich Dialog. It is started with a
                  server folder path and lists all the Files contained into this folder. It
                  communicates with its parent Rich Dialog through a fired Event
                  fileSelectionChanged@SUBSCRIBERS whenever the selection was changed. The object
                  sent by this event is a DocumentOnServer.

              <listitem>
                <para>The <ns:emphasis>SimpleFileChooserDialog</ns:emphasis>: it contains a
                  FileListChooserPane and returns the selected java.io.File. It contains also a
                  DesktopHandler to be able to open the selected File. The user can then preview the

                <para>The <ns:emphasis>FileNameDialog</ns:emphasis> allows giving a Filename and
                  optionally to choose an extension and a future place to store a created File on
                  the server. This can be usefull in processes that create files and where the user
                  should choose the name of the created file.</para>

                <para>The <ns:emphasis>FileUploadPreparer</ns:emphasis>: in some processes a user
                  has to choose some Files to upload on the server at a time when the place where to
                  store the File is not known. With the FileUploadPreparer you can then select the
                  Files to upload, and then upload them later by calling its
                    <ns:code>uploadPreparedFiles</ns:code> method.</para>

              <listitem>
                <para>The <ns:emphasis>FileListTable</ns:emphasis>: This RDC is like a very
                  simplified FileManager in the form of a RTable. It displays files contained into a
                  folder on the File Server. The user can edit or delete the displayed files. He can
                  also be used to upload some files. This RDC supports the files drag and drop from
                  the client file system.</para>
