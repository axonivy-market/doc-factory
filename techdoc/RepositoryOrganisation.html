<body><h1>Repository Organisation</h1>The IvyAddOns repository is organised in a standard subversion way with a <span style="font-style: italic;">trunk</span> for the current development a <span style="font-style: italic;">branches</span> directory where hotfixes for older versions are maintained and a <span style="font-style: italic;">tags</span> directory where tags of the releases can be found. E.g:<br><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><th>Directory</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>trunk</td><td>The
current development branch. Development in this branch will be included
in the next Xpert.ivy release (Xpert.ivy trunk). Therefore use the
latest available development build of Xpert.ivy to develop in the trunk.</td></tr><tr><td>branches/4.2</td><td>The
current development branch for Xpert.ivy 4.2. Use the latest available
HotFix Version of Xpert.ivy 4.2 to develop things here.</td></tr><tr><td>tags/4.2.x</td><td>Tags of the different IvyAddOns 4.2 Versions.
The IvyAddOns Versions are independent of Xpert.ivy HotFix Versions.
Only major and minor of IvyAddOns and Xpert.ivy must be equal.</td></tr><tr><td>tags/4.2.latestRelease</td><td>Special
tag that is linked (subversion externals) with the Xpert.ivy
development repository. The contents of this tag is overtaken to the
Xpert.ivy4.2 and its build infrastructure. The version commited here is automatically overtaken to the next Xpert.ivy 4.2 Hotfix. </td></tr><tr><td>tags/trunk.latestStable</td><td>Special
tag that is linked (subversion externals) with the Xpert.ivy
development repository. The contents of this tag is overtaken to the
latest Xpert.ivy development. The version commited here is automatically overtaken to the next Xpert.ivy Sprint Release.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>Subersion externals can be seen as mirrors or
links. The Xpert.ivy repository links to the special tags described above:<br><img src="42Externals.png" alt=""><img src="TrunkExternals.png" alt=""><br>This
means that any changes commited to these tags are automatically
overtaken to Xpert.ivy and its build infrastructure. The idea behind
this is that developers can work on the trunk or on branches until they
reached a stable version which&nbsp;they want to release. They can
release them by copying the trunk to the <span style="font-style: italic;">trunk.latestStable</span> tag or the branch 4.2 to the<span style="font-style: italic;"> 4.2.latestRelease</span> tag:<img src="TagLatest42StableRelease.png" alt=""><img src="TagLatestStableVersion.png" alt=""><br>Note that hotfixes or development made on any branch have to be merged or copied to the trunk.<br></body></html>
