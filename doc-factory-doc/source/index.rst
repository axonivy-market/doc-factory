DocFactory
************

A Document Factory is a system that automatically generates documents like mail
merge letters with the help of Microsoft Office Templates (:file:`.dot` or
:file:`.dotx` files).

You can extend the DocFactory to cover your project requirements. At the
moment, it is implemented with the commercial Java Library `Aspose
<https://www.aspose.com>`_ that we ship with the |ivy| Platform.

.. tip::

   The DocFactory currently bundles the modules aspose-words, aspose-cells,
   aspose-pdf, aspose-slides. There are additional Aspose modules such as
   aspose-barcode, aspose-ocr, aspose-diagram, that you can use in |ivy|. You
   have to add these modules from the `Aspose repository
   <https://repository.aspose.com/repo/com/aspose/>`_ to your |ivy| project and
   call the Java API. You can find the complete documentation on the Aspose
   website at `Aspose <https://www.aspose.com>`_. 

Microsoft Office templates contain fixed text and dynamic merge fields. A merge
field is a placeholder for text information. Each merge field has a name and
will be filled with the information you provide to the DocFactory.
For example, a merge field could be the address or the name of a correspondent
for a letter.
