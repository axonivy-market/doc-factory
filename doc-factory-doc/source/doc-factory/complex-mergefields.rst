Complex Mergefields (Field Update)
==================================

Aspose and its implementation in the DocFactory allow using complex field
types like IF, NEXTIF, ADDRESSBLOCK etc.. The list of the field types that are
supported and the way to handle them is explained `here
<https://docs.aspose.com/display/wordsnet/Field+Update>`_.

The DocFactory Demo uses an IF Mergefield to write a salutation depending on the
gender of the person. Such a Field can be inserted and viewed by using the
Alt+F9 shortcut in the template. Please refer to your Office documentation to
learn how to set these kinds of fields:
