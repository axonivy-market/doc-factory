<P>The following file you want to move already exists in the destination Folder:<br> - [NAME]
Do you want to overwrite it? <br>
If you press "Overwrite", the existing File is going to be overwriten and its informations are going to be lost. <br>
Clic on "Overwrite all" if you want to overwrite all the already existing files, and on "skip" if you don't want to overwrite this file.<br>
