The following has changed in IvyAddOns 7010800.0.0
---------------------------------------------

* AIPROD-172
DocFactory: When the DocumentTemplate was instantiated with constructors 
and not with the "withTemplate" static method the internal DocFactory may have been null 
which was a problem if you had set the DocumentWorker with the withDocumentWorker method (Here there was an NPE).

The following has changed in IvyAddOns 7010700.0.0 (7010700.0.0-SNAPSHOT):
---------------------------------------------
*AIPROD- 149 Option for removing all the blank pages.

The following has changed in IvyAddOns 7.1.2 (7010200.0.0-SNAPSHOT):
---------------------------------------------
* AIPROD-154: DocFactory allows creating editable PDFs
* AF-18990: The fields that are Class objects are ignored while getting the mergefields properties in beans. This allows avoiding huge 
collection of possible mergefields and therefore potential out of memory errors.

---------------------------------------------

public abstract BaseDocFactory withRegionsMergeCleanupOption (MergeCleanupOptions mergeCleanupOption);

* Moved all RichDialogs and RichDialog specific java class from IvyAddOns to IvyAddOnsRichDialog.
* Moved all DocFactory classes from IvyAddOns to DocFactory
* Moved all FileManager classes from IvyAddOns to FileManagerApi
