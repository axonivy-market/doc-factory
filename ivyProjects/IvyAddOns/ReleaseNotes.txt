IvyAddons 6030000 Release Notes 
===============================


* Issue 25838: Filemanager, a new Callable call has been placed at the end of the RD start Method for allowing to inject some custom behavior (UI changes etc....). 
The original empty Callable is placed under /IvyAddOns/processes/Functional Processes/Filemanager/Panel/RichDialogPanelDefinition.mod
and takes 2 parameters: the panel itself and the FilemanagerConfiguration. One can override this callable for customizing it.

* Issue 25839 (bug): FileManager on Oracle DB - NPE by opening a 0 byte file

* Issue 25843 DocFactory - New Feature: Possibility to use a Serializable as datasource for the mergefields. (Supports embedded Serializable objects in Serializable).
Example of use: 
DocumentTemplate documentTemplate = DocumentTemplate.withTemplate(template).putDataAsSourceForSimpleMailMerge(makePerson());
The mergefields will be named with the Serializable Class as prefix like:
person.name
person.firstname
person.address.city.cityname

* Issue 25844 DocFactory - New Feature: Possibility to use a Serializable as datasource for the mergefields with region and nested merge fields with regions.
A java Bean may contain collections of other beans which in turn may contain other collections, and so on ... We have then nested collections inside other parent collections.
These collections may be used for injecting data in nested mail merge regions of your template.
IMPORTANT
For the moment cyclic relationships are not supported. For example an Order object has a list of OrderDetails objects, each OrderDetails object has a reference to the parent Order and so on... . 
For the moment the way the DocFactory introspects the data may leads to an OutOfMemory Error. This is a well known problem and this may be supported in the future.

* Issue 25845 New QRCode API for generating QRCode images from Data.
See ch.ivyteam.ivy.addons.qrcode package

* Issue 25850 DocFactory: Insert HTML-formatted Text as merge field value
It is now possible to inject HTML-formatted text in your documents. This can be a great help if you have to change the format of your text like the text color, size, background... dynamically.
The principle is very easy: you just put some text with some HTML tags and css styles into a mergefield or in a data and the DocFactory engine will automatically inject your text as HTML in the document.

IvyAddons 5010600 Release Notes 
===============================

* Issue 25423: Bug fix. Filemanager: file tags are not deleted if related file is removed.
The result of this bug is that some tags remain in the db without reference to any existing file. No user can see the bug but your database contains some unnecessary data.
Workaround to manually clean the db (DISCLAIMER: PLEASE ALWAYS DO A DB BACKUP BEFORE USING SUCH A QUERY):
delete from tags t where not exists (select * from uploadedfiles f where f.fileid = t.fileid);

* Issue 25439: Improvement. HTML FileManager API in IvyAddons: HtmlFileManagerThumbnailer createFullSizeImages method should create temp images only.
* Issue 25440: Improvement. Filemanager: when displayed recursively the selected document displays its path in the filemanager info.
If the Directory Translation feature is activated, the path is displayed with the translated directories names.

* Issue 25558: new feature FileLinks. There is the possibility to create some fileLinks with the API. A FileLink links to an existing document or version.
To be able to activate this feature you have to create a new file_links table in the filemanager db. For more info about the create SQL Scripts, 
please look at the following folder in this project: sql/5010600/
* Issue 25559: Improvement. Filemanager. When the Filemanager loads the files, a check is made to unlock automatically all the files that are locked 
by users which session is not active anymore. This allows avoiding that files stay in locked state after sessions have timed-out.
